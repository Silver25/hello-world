# hello-world
This repository is for practising the GitHub Flow and all other interesting trinkets to accomplish the creation of the amazing project.

## Purpose

## Interactive Responsive Website

## UX Design
Proposed by Jesse James Garrett, this process is represented as five levels of activity called planes.  
These planes and their concerns are as follows.

### First Time Visitor Goals

### Returning Visitor Goals

### The strategy plane: 
What are you aiming to achieve in the first place and for whom?

### The scope plane: 
Which features, based on information from the strategy plane, do you want to include in your design?
What's on the table for a production release and what's not, at least for now?

### The structure plane: 
How is the information structured and how is it logically grouped?

### The skeleton plane: 
How will our information be represented, and how will the user navigate to the information and the features?

### The surface plane: 
What will the finished product look like?
What colors, typography, and design elements will we use?
